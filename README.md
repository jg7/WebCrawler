WebCrawler
==========

This is a web crawler I implemented in python!

Usage:
1.Download and install Python 2.6.
2.Run:
      
      python webcrawler.py seed_url keyword
      
Here,
seed_url is the starting url to build your index
and keyword is the keyword you want to search for in your index.
          
          
Have fun!
